                Customers and devices can be taken from a database. Your team manages customers, devices, and contracts in an app. Your technicians need the master data for customer visits and the documentation of service activities.

                <img class="imglftshadow" width="75px" src="../images/appointment.png" alt="image:appointment"/>
                Your service orders contain all relevant information about the customer, device and appointment with just a few clicks. Automatically generated reminders for the next service activities help your team plan new service appointments.

                <img class="imglftshadow" width="75px" src="../images/checklist.png" alt="image:checklist"/>
                Your technicians scan the customer inventory using a barcode, QR code or NFC tag, or they use the information from a service order. This means that the customer and device data is pre-populated for the service activity and your technicians only record the results.

                For each service activity, a service report (PDF file) is automatically created when requested. The team is notified of new service documents by email and reviews them. Incorrect data is corrected. If everything is correct, the service report must be approved.

                A script regularly updates the Excel-based Pivot reports. This gives you a dashboard, a list of visited customers and a technician schedule. A Power BI report can be included also.
